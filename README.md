# MRI Image Style Transfer with CycleGAN and DualGAN

## Project Overview
This project applies advanced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically CycleGAN and DualGAN, for style transfer in MRI images, using the BraTS2020 challenge datasets. It demonstrates the potential of GANs in medical imaging.

## Datasets
The datasets are sourced from the BraTS2020 challenge, comprising a diverse collection of MRI images suitable for testing the efficacy of style transfer techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
- Other necessary libraries and frameworks

## Features
- Implementation of CycleGAN and DualGAN for MRI image style transfer.
- In-depth analysis and performance evaluation of GAN architectures.
- Visual representation of style transfer outcomes.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Execute the `Final_MRI_CycleGAN.ipynb` and `Final_MRI_DualGAN.ipynb` notebooks.
